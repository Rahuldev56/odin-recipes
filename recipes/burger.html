    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved culinary masterpiece that combines a crispy, golden crust with a variety of savory toppings. At its heart is a rich tomato sauce, seasoned with herbs and spices, spread generously across the base. A layer of gooey, melted cheese melds with the sauce, creating a satisfying, stringy texture.

         A layer of gooey, melted cheese melds with the sauce, creating a satisfying, stringy texture. From classic pepperoni to inventive combinations like pineapple and prosciutto, the topping options are virtually limitless. Each bite offers a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, from the crunch of the crust to the smoothness of the cheese. Baked to perfection in a hot oven, pizza is both comforting and versatile, making it a favorite across the globe.

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        
       <li> 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed. </li>
      <li> 1 cup cooked quinoa (or cooked rice)</li>  
       <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li> 
     <li>1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper (any color)</li>   
       <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
       <li>1 egg (or a flax egg for a vegan option: 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water)</li> 
       <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprikav</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>In a large bowl, mash the black beans with a fork or potato masher until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.</li>
       <li>Add the cooked quinoa, chopped onion, bell pepper, minced garlic, and breadcrumbs to the mashed beans. Stir until combined.</li>
       <li>Stir in the egg (or flax egg), ground cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. The mixture should hold together when formed into patties. If too wet, add more breadcrumbs; if too dry, add a splash of water or olive oil.</li>
       <li>Shape the mixture into 4-6 patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
       <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Alternatively, bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
       <li>Lightly toast the burger buns in the same skillet or oven until golden brown.</li>
       <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and cover the skillet with a lid to melt the cheese.</li>
       <li>Spread condiments on the buns. Place the cooked veggie patty with melted cheese on the bottom bun. Add lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
       <li>Serve your veggie burgers hot with your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
