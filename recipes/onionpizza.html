    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>
        This french onion pizza is exactly what we need this December. A simple, no-fuss kind of dinner that could not be more comforting. Once you get the onions on the stovetop, they take about an hour to cook, but the process is completely hands-off (other than some stirring, of course).
    
    </p>
    <p>
        They get cooked with butter, thyme, bay leaves, sherry wine, and beef stock to give them the rich flavors of french onion soup. Combine those with lots of gruyere and mozzarella cheese? The perfect winter pizza.
